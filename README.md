Software development for a first year engineering module, EM106, at [Dublin City University](http://www.dcu.ie). Students must build and demonstrate an [automated guided vehicle (AGV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle). The embedded control system is based on the [arduino nano 33 BLE module](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble), and programmed in python using the [micropython environment via the OpenMV IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano-33-ble/ble-python-api). Design patterns using [uasyncio](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/v3/docs/TUTORIAL.md).
